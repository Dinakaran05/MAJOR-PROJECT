STEPS FOR EXECUTION
TITLE:  Transparent Orphanage Support System for Childrenâ€™s Health Welfare Using Network Security
Software Requirements
1. Front End: Java, J2EE (JSP, Servlets), JavaScript
2. Back End: MySQL 5.5 or later
3. Operating System: Windows 7 or later
4. IDE: Eclipse IDE
5. Web Server: Apache Tomcat (for deploying JSP/Servlets)
6. Database Management Tool: MySQL Workbench or similar

STEP 1: Environment Setup
1. Install Java Development Kit (JDK)
   - Download and install the latest JDK from Oracle's website.
   - Set up the JAVA_HOME environment variable.

2. Install Eclipse IDE
   - Download Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers from the Eclipse website.
   - Install and configure it with the installed JDK.

3. Install MySQL
   - Download and install MySQL 5.5 or later.
   - Install MySQL Workbench for database management.
   - Create a database named orphanage_support (or as specified in your project).

4. Install Apache Tomcat
   - Download Apache Tomcat (version compatible with your J2EE version).
   - Configure Tomcat in Eclipse as a server runtime environment.

STEP 2: Project Setup in Eclipse
1. Create a Dynamic Web Project
   - Open Eclipse and create a new "Dynamic Web Project."
   - Name it appropriately (e.g., OrphanageSupportSystem).
   - Select the target runtime as Apache Tomcat.

2. Import Project Files
   - Copy the provided JSP files (e.g., index.jsp, TrustRegister.jsp) into the WebContent folder of your project.
   - Ensure all required libraries (e.g., MySQL Connector/J, Bootstrap, etc.) are added to the WEB-INF/lib folder.

3. Database Configuration
   - Create the necessary tables in MySQL as per the database design shown in the document.
   - Update the database connection details in the project (typically in a DBUtil.java or similar file).

STEP 3: Database Setup
1. Create Tables
   - Use the provided database schema to create tables like Trusts, Donors, Government_Admin, Hospitals, etc.
   - Example SQL for creating tables:
     sql
     CREATE TABLE Trusts (
         trust_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
         username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
         password VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
         email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
         contact_no VARCHAR(15) NOT NULL,
         address TEXT,
         proof_path VARCHAR(255)
     );
     

2. Insert Sample Data
   - Populate the tables with sample data for testing:
     sql
     INSERT INTO Trusts (username, password, email, contact_no, address) 
     VALUES ('trust1', 'password123', 'trust1@example.com', '+911234567890', '123 Orphanage St, City');
     

STEP 4: Deploy and Run the Project
1. Configure Tomcat Server
   - In Eclipse, right-click the project and select "Run As" > "Run on Server."
   - Choose the configured Tomcat server and finish the setup.

2. Access the Application
   - Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/OrphanageSupportSystem/index.jsp.
   - The homepage should load, displaying the navigation menu and slideshow.

STEP 5: Testing the Modules
1. Trust/Donor Registration
   - Navigate to the registration page (Trusts_RegLogin.jsp or similar).
   - Fill in the form with test data and submit.
   - Verify the data is saved in the Trusts table.

2. Login Functionality
   - Use the registered credentials to log in.
   - Ensure the login redirects to the appropriate dashboard.

3. Donation Flow
   - Log in as a donor and simulate a donation.
   - Verify the donation is recorded and linked to the intended orphanage/child.

4. Government Approval
   - Log in as a government admin and approve a trust's request.
   - Check if the approval triggers the transfer of funds to the hospital.

 STEP 6: Debugging and Troubleshooting
1. Common Issues
   - Database Connection Errors: Verify the MySQL service is running and the connection URL, username, and password are correct.
   - JSP/Servlet Errors: Check the server logs in Eclipse for detailed error messages.
   - Missing Libraries: Ensure all JAR files (e.g., MySQL Connector, Bootstrap) are in the WEB-INF/lib folder.

2. Logging
   - Add logging statements in servlets to track the flow of execution:
     java
     System.out.println("Debug: Reached servlet method XYZ");
     

STEP 7: Final Steps
1. Build and Export
   - Once testing is complete, export the project as a WAR file:
     - Right-click the project > Export > WAR file.
   - Deploy the WAR file on a production server if needed.

2. Documentation
   - Refer to the provided document for UML diagrams (use case, state, activity, etc.) to understand the system flow.
   - Review the AES algorithm implementation for encryption/decryption if applicable.
